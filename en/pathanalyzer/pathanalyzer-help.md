# Getting started with Path Analyzer
The Path Analyzer is an application that enables you to create a map that shows the sequential paths that contacts take as they navigate through your website. You can see the paths that contacts take while interacting with campaigns, and on their way to converting on business critical activities such as goals and outcomes.

## Maps
Maps are a visual representation of the paths that contacts take through your website. Maps consist of three basic elements:
- Tree - the basic structure of a map, containing paths, or branches, radiating out from the map's central node. 
- Path - consist of groups of nodes that represent the sequential pages that contacts have interacted with.
- Nodes - the individual pages that a contact has visited. Several nodes together form a path.
### Map key
When you read a path analyzer map, the size and color of the nodes and the lines between nodes provide you with information about which paths provide the most visits and value to your organization. The color of a node provides you with information about the value per visit that the node produces.
### Map views
When you use the Path Analyzer to create maps, there are four different views that you can choose from to receive your information. 
- Radial
- Vertical
- Horizontal
- Table
Each view provides you with different advantages as to how you receive the map's information, for example, providing you with an overview or simplifying the structure so you can better follow individual paths on smaller maps.

### Map Operations
#### Filter a map by path
#### Filter a map by metrics
#### Export a map

## Reports
### Most visited
The paths that generate the highest traffic
### Most valuable
The paths that generate the highest engagement value
### Most valuable and visited
The paths that generate the highest engagement value and the highest traffic
### Most efficient
The paths on your site that generate the highest value per visit
### Paths without value
The paths that do not generate any engagement value
### Optimization candidates
The paths that receive a high number of visits but do not generate high value per visit
